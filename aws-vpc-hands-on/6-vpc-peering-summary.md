# AWS VPC Peering üöÄ

This document provides a detailed summary of **AWS VPC Peering**, including its use cases, benefits, limitations, and scenarios. It also contains exam and interview questions for easy review.

---

## What is AWS VPC Peering? ü§î

- AWS VPC Peering allows **private communication between two VPCs**.
- Resources in **VPC A** can communicate with resources in **VPC B** over a private network.
- Peering can be established:
  - **Within the same AWS region**
  - **Across AWS regions**
  - **Across different AWS accounts**

---

## Features & Benefits üåü

- **Private network connectivity** between VPCs without public IPs.
- No need for **Internet Gateways, VPN connections, or Direct Connect** for inter-VPC communication.
- **Cost-effective**: Pay only for data transfer; no VPN hourly charges.
- **Highly available & scalable**: No single point of failure; infrastructure scales automatically.

## Common Scenarios for VPC Peering üõ†Ô∏è

### 1. Simple Use Case
- Connect VPCs for different departments (e.g., Finance & Accounting).
- Full access between VPCs without exposing resources publicly.

### 2. Multiple Branches
- Connect multiple VPCs across locations (e.g., US & India branches).
- Requires multiple peering connections: A‚ÜîB, B‚ÜîC, A‚ÜîC.

### 3. Spoke Model (Centralized VPC)
- Central VPC A connected to multiple VPCs (B, C, D).
- Branch VPCs cannot communicate directly with each other.
- Use cases:
  - Centralized **file sharing**
  - Centralized **AD for authentication**
  - SaaS applications for multiple customers
  - Centralized **DevOps management** (Chef servers, monitoring)

---

## Limitations & Unsupported Configurations ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Limitations
- **No overlapping CIDRs** between VPCs.
- **Single peering connection** per pair of VPCs.
- **Non-transitive**: A‚ÜîB & A‚ÜîC does NOT allow B‚ÜîC communication.

### Unsupported Scenarios
1. **VPC connected to corporate network via VPN/Direct Connect**:
   - Peered VPC cannot access corporate network through peering.
2. **Internet access via peering**:
   - Instances in VPC B cannot access the internet via VPC A‚Äôs Internet Gateway or NAT Gateway.
3. **VPC Endpoint Services (S3/DynamoDB)**:
   - Peered VPC cannot access endpoint services through the peering connection.

---

## Key Takeaways ‚úÖ

- VPC peering **enables direct private communication** between instances in VPCs.
- Ideal for **departmental apps, branch offices, multi-tenant SaaS, and centralized management**.
- Important to understand **limitations** to avoid misconfiguration.

## Exam Questions üéì

1. **What is AWS VPC Peering?**  
   - *Answer:* A networking connection that allows private communication between two VPCs.

2. **Can VPC peering be established across regions?**  
   - *Answer:* Yes, AWS now supports inter-region VPC peering.

3. **Does VPC peering allow transitive routing?**  
   - *Answer:* No, peering connections are non-transitive.

4. **Can a peered VPC access the internet via the other VPC‚Äôs Internet Gateway?**  
   - *Answer:* No, this is unsupported.

5. **Name one cost benefit of VPC peering over VPN.**  
   - *Answer:* You save on VPN hourly charges; pay only for data transfer.

## Interview Questions üíº

1. Explain the difference between VPC peering and VPN connection.  
   - *Answer:* VPC peering is private AWS-to-AWS VPC communication; VPN connects VPC to on-premises network.

2. What is a spoke model in VPC peering?  
   - *Answer:* Central VPC connected to multiple VPCs; branch VPCs cannot communicate directly.

3. Can two VPCs with overlapping CIDRs be peered?  
   - *Answer:* No, overlapping CIDRs are not allowed.

4. How do you connect VPCs across different AWS accounts?  
   - *Answer:* Use cross-account VPC peering connections.

5. What are common use cases for VPC peering?  
   - *Answer:* Departmental apps, SaaS multi-tenancy, centralized management, branch office connectivity.

---

## Advanced Exam Questions üß†

1. How does AWS ensure high availability in VPC peering?  
   - *Answer:* There is no single point of failure; AWS automatically scales the underlying infrastructure.

2. Explain why VPC peering is non-transitive.  
   - *Answer:* To enhance security and restrict communication between peered VPCs.

3. Can VPC peering be used to access S3 endpoint services in another VPC?  
   - *Answer:* No, endpoint services cannot be accessed via VPC peering.

4. How many peering connections are needed to connect three VPCs in full-mesh?  
   - *Answer:* Three connections: A‚ÜîB, B‚ÜîC, A‚ÜîC.

5. Describe a SaaS multi-tenant scenario using VPC peering.  
   - *Answer:* Central VPC hosts SaaS app; each customer has own VPC; peering connects customer VPCs to central VPC for private access.

---

## Advanced Interview Questions üí°

1. How do you monitor traffic between peered VPCs?  
   - *Answer:* Use VPC Flow Logs or CloudWatch metrics.

2. Explain limitations of using NAT Gateway for peered VPC traffic.  
   - *Answer:* Peered VPC cannot route traffic through NAT Gateway of another VPC.

3. Can you implement transitive peering? How?  
   - *Answer:* Not directly; requires Transit Gateway or VPN solutions.

4. What considerations are needed for inter-region VPC peering?  
   - *Answer:* Latency, bandwidth costs, and compliance with cross-region rules.

5. Explain a real-world DevOps centralized management scenario using VPC peering.  
   - *Answer:* Chef server in central VPC manages client instances across multiple customer-specific VPCs.
