# üîê AWS VPC Private Connectivity Options

## üìñ Lecture Summary

### üîπ Introduction
- Focus: **VPC Private Connectivity options**.  
- Goes beyond communication *within* a single VPC.  
- Covers:  
  - **VPC Endpoints (Gateway + Interface/PrivateLink)**  
  - **VPC Peering**  
  - **Transit Gateway**  
  - **Site-to-Site VPN**  
  - **Client VPN**  
  - **Direct Connect**

---

### üîπ VPC Endpoints & PrivateLink
- Normally, private subnets need internet access (via NAT/IGW) to connect to services like S3.  
- **VPC Endpoints** provide **private connectivity** within AWS network.  
- Two types:
  1. **Gateway Endpoint** ‚Üí For **S3 & DynamoDB** (most common).  
  2. **Interface Endpoint (PrivateLink)** ‚Üí For many other AWS services (API Gateway, SQS, etc.).  
- Benefits:
  - No need for NAT/IGW.  
  - Traffic stays within AWS network.  
  - Lower latency + more secure.  
- PrivateLink also allows accessing **third-party or customer services** privately.

---

### üîπ VPC Peering
- Connects **two VPCs** privately using **private IPs**.  
- Works **within same region or across regions**.  
- Properties:
  - **Point-to-point** (1:1).  
  - **Non-transitive** ‚Üí If A‚ÜîB and B‚ÜîC, then A‚â†C unless explicitly peered.  
- Use Case: Communication between applications hosted in separate VPCs.  

---

### üîπ Transit Gateway
- A **regional router** to simplify multi-VPC connectivity.  
- Benefits:
  - Connects **multiple VPCs** via **one central hub**.  
  - Avoids complexity of multiple peering connections.  
  - Can connect with **on-prem networks via VPN or Direct Connect**.  
  - **Supports inter-region peering** between transit gateways.  
- Trade-off:
  - Simplifies networking but adds **extra cost**.

---

### üîπ Site-to-Site VPN
- **Hybrid connectivity** between on-premises network and AWS VPC.  
- Uses **IPsec tunnels** (AWS provides **two tunnels** for HA).  
- Enables accessing AWS resources via **private IPs**.  
- Extends corporate network into AWS.  

---

### üîπ Client VPN
- Connects **individual clients/users** securely to AWS VPC.  
- Example: Employees working from home accessing private VPC resources.  
- Works similar to **corporate VPNs** but inside AWS.  

---

### üîπ Direct Connect
- **Dedicated physical connection** between AWS and on-premises datacenter.  
- Bypasses the internet ‚Üí stable, low latency, high bandwidth (50 Mbps ‚Üí 100 Gbps).  
- Benefits:
  - Consistent performance.  
  - Lower data transfer cost vs internet.  
  - Access AWS **private (VPC)** and **public services (S3, EIPs, etc.)**.  
- Requires working with a **Direct Connect Partner** to establish physical connectivity.

# VPC Private Connectivity Options


So we are now reached to the interesting topic which is **VPC Private Connectivity options**.

And we are going to talk about all these options in this lecture.

And we are just going to touch this at **high level** because later in section two we have **labs for all these topics**.

So let's dive into this now okay.

So so far we talked about **VPC only**.

That means all the communication within the **VPC**.

But now let's go beyond the VPC.

And let's see what kind of **features AWS provide in order to communicate outside the VPC**.

So we are going to talk about:

- **VPC endpoints and private links**  
- **VPC peering connections**  
- **Transit gateways**  
- **Site-to-site VPN connection**  
- **Client VPN**  
- **Direct Connect**

Okay.

So let's now look into these topics.

So this is a **VPC**.

And I have simplified the architecture where you have just **one public subnet** and **the private subnet**.

And then there is **one EC2 machine in a private subnet** which means it cannot talk to internet because there is also **no NAT gateway** right here.

So this is an architecture.

And imagine that you have an **application which is kind of processing some data from S3**.

Now if you know AWS, you should know that **S3 is a storage service** so that you can store your files, video files or text files, anything in the **S3**.

And then **EC2 machine can access this over the internet**.

So if this is the architecture and this **application server wants to upload or download anything from S3**, then this instance will need **outbound internet access**.

Because **S3 service doesn't sit inside your VPC**, it sits into **AWS network**.

So access to S3 is **over the internet** in that sense.

So if this application server wants to access S3, it will also follow the same route.

Now this works okay and there is no problem with that.

But as you will see here, because **S3 service itself sits in the AWS network** and **VPC also sits into the AWS network**.

**AWS provides a better way to access the S3 bucket in the same AWS region**.

So AWS says that if you are going to access **S3 bucket in the same region as your VPC**, then why don't you use something called **VPC endpoint**?

And there are two types of the endpoint:

1. **Gateway endpoint**  
2. **Private link endpoint**

So here, if you want to access **S3 or DynamoDB services through the VPC**, then you **don't need an NAT gateway or an internet gateway attached to your VPC**.

This machine here can **access S3 and DynamoDB privately over this VPC endpoint**.

Okay, so that's about the **VPC endpoint**.

Now there are many other services in AWS like **API Gateway**, **SQS queue**, and so many others, maybe 100 or more.

Right.

And all these other services can also be reached **privately from the VPC without having the internet connectivity** to the server.

And for that you need to have the **VPC endpoint of type interface**.

So it is called **VPC interface endpoint**.

Again you can connect to this **AWS services over this endpoint**.

And this connectivity between the **VPC and the AWS services is also called Private Link**.

Okay.

Moving on.

So many a times what happens?

You want to access some **third party services**.

Now maybe you are accessing some **SaaS application** or you are providing your **services privately to your customers**.

Now in that case, if you have this application service here, of course one option is to **expose it over the internet**.

And anybody who wants to consume your services can connect to these services over the internet.

But if you see this architecture, this is inside **AWS network in a different VPC** and you have your own **VPC**.

So here also AWS provides a way to **privately access these services**.

And again this is through a **private link**.

So what you do:

- You create a **VPC interface endpoint** for this particular service which is called a **customer service**.  
- And then you connect to it over a **private link**.

So at this point, **don't worry if this is not very clear**, but we are going to do **labs for all these topics** and it will be **very, very clear** to you.

But the point here is that you can **access other AWS services privately through the VPC endpoint and private link**.

I hope that is clear now.

With that, let's move to the next topic which is **VPC Peering Connection**.

Now so far we are just talking about **single VPC** and then **how to access AWS services privately**.

But in the **real world there will be many, many VPCs**.

Now within the same organization probably there are **multiple VPCs** because there are **different applications** and there are **different application owner teams**.

Right.

So they **don't want to just launch everything in a single VPC and then fight over who does what**.

Rather, it is **best practice to have a VPC around your application**.

Right.

So **different application, different VPCs**.

Also if your **customer is also operating in AWS environment** then your **customers will also have the VPCs**.

Now the question is if there are so many VPCs and **one application wants to communicate with another application**, how do they do this right now?

Of course, one of the ways is to **expose your application over the internet**, through the **internet gateway**, by putting it in a **public subnet**, and then anybody can access it.

But you **don't want to do that** because it's a **private application**.

So you only want that the **application within your company can only access that particular application**.

So how do you do that?

That means you need to **connect to VPCs privately without exposing over to the internet**.

So that's where **VPC peering comes into the play**.

So if there is **one VPC here and then another VPC either in the same AWS region or a different AWS region**, you can connect these VPCs through a **VPC peering connection**.

Now, as soon as you peer to VPCs, this **EC2 machine here can communicate with any of the EC2 machine in another VPC**, and that too using the **private IP address**.

You **don't need to have them in a public subnet or have the public IP address**.

So once you have this **peering connection**, then these VPCs can **communicate with each other**.

Now there are certain properties about **VPC peering** that it's **1-to-1**.

That means **this VPC and this VPC can communicate now**, and also **this VPC, A and C can communicate**, but **VPC B and C cannot communicate** because they are **not peered**.

So **VPC peering is not transitive in nature** in that sense.

Right.

And we'll talk more about that when we'll reach to the **labs of VPC peering**.

Okay I hope that is clear.

So if you want to have **private connectivity between multiple VPCs**, whether in the same AWS region or different AWS regions, then you should use **VPC peering connection**.

So okay, this works well as long as you have maybe a couple of VPCs to connect to each other because it's **point-to-point connection**.

But imagine a situation where now you have got **many VPCs** because your organization is big and there are **multiple applications**, and all these applications **wants to communicate with each other**.

So something like this.

Now we are taking an example of **four VPCs**.

Now if you want to have a **VPC peering connection** and all these VPCs wants to communicate with each other, then **how many VPC peering connections will you have?**

So 1,2,3,4.

But this is not enough.

**This VPC and this VPC is not connected. So one more connection.**

And again **this VPC and this VPC is not connected. So one more connection.**

So only for **four VPCs** you have got **six VPC peering connections**.

And now imagine you have **ten VPCs or 50 VPCs**.

How many such connections will be? There is a **mathematical formula** for that.

But of course you **don't want to get into that much of the complexity**.

So if that's the situation, it's better to use another networking component in AWS that is a **Transit Gateway**.

So instead of **1-to-1 VPC peering connection**, you bring in the **Transit Gateway**, which is a **regional router**, and then **connect all these VPCs to it**.

Now **all these VPCs can communicate with each other through this transit gateway**.

Now the question is then, does it mean that always you should use **Transit Gateway**?

So there are **pros and cons**.

Of course it **simplifies the network complexity**, but there is **additional cost** of using the **transit gateway**.

So you need to **make that trade-off** when you choose one of the networking component over the other.

And we'll talk about that as we get into this topic in more details.

Okay.

So I hope that is clear.

Now, **Transit Gateway is not just for connecting the VPCs**.

It is much more than that.

What I mean, so you can also have a **VPN connection going to the transit gateway** so that your **on-premise network** can also now communicate with multiple VPCs through this **transit gateway**.

So if you really look at this, this **simplifies your networking a lot**.

If there is no transit gateway and you want to **access your VPCs from your on-premise network**, then you would have to have **multiple VPN connections to individual VPCs**.

But with this architecture, that **all complexity is gone**.

And again, in the **Transit Gateway lecture** we are going to look at some of these scenarios.

So **Transit Gateway also connects to on-premise network over a VPN connection**.

And finally **transit gateways can also be peered across AWS region**.

So **transit gateways are regional routers**, which means **Transit Gateway cannot connect to a VPC in a different region**.

Instead, you can **create another transit gateway in a different AWS region** and **pair these two transit gateways**.

And now the **traffic can flow between all these VPCs across AWS regions**, right.

So this is also a good architecture okay.

So I hope the **transit gateway is clear**.

## Site-to-Site VPN

Now let's quickly look at the **Site-to-Site VPN**.

- **Site-to-Site VPN** is used as a **hybrid network**, which means you want to connect your **on-premise network** to the **AWS network**.  

- Example architecture:  


- **Why use Site-to-Site VPN?**  
- If you have your **applications deployed inside a VPC** and you **don't want to expose those applications publicly**, but you **want to access it from your on-premise network**, you set up a VPN connection.  
- Then an **EC2 machine with private IP** can be accessed from your **on-premise network over that private IP address**.  

- Essentially, you are **connecting two networks together**, allowing **private access without public exposure**.

- **AWS provides a VPN gateway**, and you set up an **IPSec tunnel** between your router and this VPN gateway.  

- For **high availability**, AWS provides **two tunnels**.  

- We'll cover **detailed setup in labs**, but **as of now understand** that **Site-to-Site VPN is used for hybrid network scenarios**.

---

## Client VPN

Now with **Client VPN**:

- **Site-to-Site VPN** connects **two networks**, whereas **Client VPN** connects a **client to the AWS VPC network privately**.  

- **Use case**:  
- Suppose you are working from home and want to access **private resources inside your corporate VPC**.  
- You **connect to the company VPN** (similar concept in AWS).  
- In AWS, you **create a Client VPN endpoint**, connect to this endpoint, and now **access VPC private resources over this VPN connection**.  

- This is called **Client-to-Site VPN** or **Client VPN**.

- Labs will provide hands-on experience.

- These are the **two types of VPN in AWS** used in **hybrid network scenarios**.

---

## Direct Connect

Finally, let's discuss **Direct Connect**:

- **What is Direct Connect?**  
- **Direct Connect** is a **physical network connection** from **AWS to your data center**.

- **Current scenario without Direct Connect**:  
- Access AWS resources from **on-premise network** over the **internet** or **VPN**.  
- VPN traffic **still goes over the internet**, albeit encrypted.

- **Problem**:  
- For large enterprises with **high workloads in AWS and on-premises**, the **internet is inconsistent**.  
- Issues include **jitter, limited bandwidth, multiple hops**.

- **Solution**:  
- Set up a **dedicated physical network** between your **data center** and AWS through **Direct Connect locations**.  
- Provides **reliable and consistent network connectivity**.

- **How it works**:  
1. Work with a **Direct Connect Partner**.  
2. Set up a **physical network between your data center and Direct Connect location**.  
3. AWS region has an **established connection** with the Direct Connect location.  
4. Your data center now connects to AWS over a **private dedicated link**.  

- **Benefits**:  
- **Dedicated network**  
- **Bandwidth from 50 Mbps up to 100 Gbps**  
- **Lower data transfer cost** compared to the internet  
- Access **all AWS resources**, including **VPC resources, S3, public IPs, Elastic IPs**.  

- **Summary**:  
- **Direct Connect** = dedicated, high-bandwidth, private network between **on-premises** and **AWS**.
