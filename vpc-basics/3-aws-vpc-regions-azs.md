# AWS VPC, Regions, and Availability Zones ‚Äì Learning Notes üìö

This repository contains my **AWS learning notes** on VPCs, Regions, Availability Zones, and service scopes.  
Purpose: Understand **VPC scope** and its relationship with AWS accounts, regions, and AZs.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Purpose of the Lecture
- Clarifies the scope of VPCs and their relation to AWS account, regions, and AZs.  
- Answers questions like: *Can a VPC host resources across AWS regions or accounts?*  

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ AWS Regions & Availability Zones (AZs)
- AWS currently has **32 regions** and **102 AZs** (numbers growing over time).  
- Regions are chosen based on:
  - User base location üåç  
  - Data residency requirements üóÑÔ∏è  
- Each region has multiple AZs for **high availability**:
  - Physically separated with redundant power ‚ö°  
  - Designed to survive natural disasters üå™Ô∏è  

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ VPC Scope
- **VPCs are regional resources** ‚Äî created in a specific AWS region.  
- To use multiple regions, **create separate VPCs** in each region.  
- Communication between VPCs:
  - VPC Peering  
  - Transit Gateway  

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ AWS Account and Region Relationship
- AWS account = **top-level entity** üè¢  
- Within an account, you can deploy workloads in any region.  
- Examples:
  - Mumbai ‚Üí 3 AZs  
  - North Virginia ‚Üí 6 AZs  

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Multiple VPCs in a Region
- Default limit: 5 VPCs per region (can be increased).  
- Reasons to create multiple VPCs:
  - Isolate applications logically  
  - Example: Finance app in one VPC, AI app in another  

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Subnets and AZ Mapping
- **EC2 instances** are deployed in a specific AZ.  
- **Subnets** define which AZ resources reside in.  
- To deploy across multiple AZs ‚Üí create multiple subnets in the VPC.  

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ AWS Service Scopes
| Service Type | Examples | Scope |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| AZ-level | EC2, RDS | Resources deployed in a specific AZ |
| VPC-level | ELB | Distributes traffic across AZs in a VPC |
| Regional-level | S3 | Exists in a region, outside VPC, accessible via internet |
| Global-level | Route 53, IAM, Billing | Operate across regions globally |

---

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Summary Hierarchy
1. **AWS Account** ‚Üí Top-level entity  
2. **Regions** ‚Üí Multiple per account  
3. **VPCs** ‚Üí One or more per region  
4. **Subnets** ‚Üí Mapped to AZs within a VPC  
5. **Resources** ‚Üí Deployed in subnets (EC2, RDS), accessed depending on service scope

## üìù Exam Questions & Answers ‚Äì AWS VPC, Regions, and AZs

1. **Q:** Can a single VPC span multiple AWS regions?  
   **A:** No, a VPC is a regional resource. To use multiple regions, you must create separate VPCs in each region and connect them via VPC Peering or Transit Gateway.

2. **Q:** What determines the number of Availability Zones in a region?  
   **A:** Each region has multiple physically separated AZs to provide high availability, redundant power, and disaster resilience. The exact number varies per region.

3. **Q:** How are subnets related to AZs?  
   **A:** Subnets define which AZ resources (like EC2 instances) reside in. To deploy resources across multiple AZs, create multiple subnets mapped to each AZ.

4. **Q:** What is the default VPC limit per region, and why might you create multiple VPCs?  
   **A:** The default limit is 5 VPCs per region. Multiple VPCs can be created to isolate applications logically, e.g., separate VPCs for Finance and AI applications.

5. **Q:** Give examples of AWS service scopes and their levels.  
   **A:**  
   - AZ-level: EC2, RDS  
   - VPC-level: ELB  
   - Regional-level: S3  
   - Global-level: Route 53, IAM, Billing

## üíº Interview Questions & Answers ‚Äì AWS VPC, Regions, and AZs

1. **Q:** Explain why a VPC cannot span multiple regions.  
   **A:** A VPC is a regional resource designed to operate within a single region. Cross-region communication requires creating separate VPCs and connecting them via VPC Peering or Transit Gateway.

2. **Q:** How do you ensure high availability for resources deployed in a VPC?  
   **A:** Deploy resources across multiple subnets in different AZs within the VPC to ensure redundancy and availability if one AZ fails.

3. **Q:** What is the relationship between AWS accounts, regions, and VPCs?  
   **A:** An AWS account is the top-level entity. Within an account, multiple regions exist. Each region can host one or more VPCs, and each VPC contains subnets mapped to AZs.

4. **Q:** How do you choose the appropriate region for deploying your VPC?  
   **A:** Consider factors such as proximity to users (latency), data residency requirements, compliance, and cost differences across regions.

5. **Q:** Describe the difference between AZ-level and global-level services.  
   **A:** AZ-level services (EC2, RDS) exist in a specific AZ. Global-level services (Route 53, IAM) operate across all regions and accounts, providing centralized management and global reach.
